The additional feature of “candidate management” increases the feasibility to conduct a test on a large group of candidates in a systematic manner. It allows the test taker to categorize the candidates in their respective groups and at the time of conducting the test, the test taker can assign individual tests to every group, conducting multiple tests at once.</p>

The online examination system provides a comprehensive report system that is highly accurate and instant. The software can instantly score the test paper according to the marks assigned by the test creator. Later, a test report is generated that provides scores on every subject, section, and question of the test.</p>
